Explain the difference between the following C++ expressions:

Case 1:
const char* a = "Nello";
std::cout << a;

Case 2:
char* b = "Nello";
std::cout << b;


The difference between the two cases lies in the use of the const keyword
In Case 1, const char* a = "Nello"; declares a pointer to a constant character. 
This means that the characters that a points to cannot be changed through a. 
The string "Nello" is stored in read-only memory, and a points to that. 
If you try to modify the string through a, it will result in undefined behavior.

In Case 2, char* b = "Nello"; declares a pointer to a character. 
This implies that the characters that b points to can be changed. 
However, in C++, string literals like "Nello" are still stored in read-only memory, 
so attempting to modify them will result in undefined behavior. 
This is actually not valid C++ code, even though it may compile and run 
without errors in some compilers due to backward compatibility with C.

In summary, the main difference is that const char* a is a pointer to a constant character 
(you can't change the value of the character), 
while char* b is a pointer to a character (you can change the value of the character). 
However, in both cases, attempting to modify the string literal will result 
in undefined behavior because string literals are stored in read-only memory in C++.
