Prefer int when the size of the integer doesn’t matter (e.g. the number will always fit within the range of a 2-byte signed integer). For example, if you’re asking the user to enter their age, or counting from 1 to 10, it doesn’t matter whether int is 16 or 32 bits (the numbers will fit either way). This will cover the vast majority of the cases you’re likely to run across.
Prefer std::int#_t when storing a quantity that needs a guaranteed range.
Prefer std::uint#_t when doing bit manipulation or where well-defined wrap-around behavior is required.
Avoid the following when possible:

short and long integers -- use a fixed-width type instead.
Unsigned types for holding quantities.
The 8-bit fixed-width integer types.
The fast and least fixed-width types.
Any compiler-specific fixed-width integers -- for example, Visual Studio defines __int8, __int16, etc…
