The one definition rule (ODR) 

The one definition rule (or ODR for short) is a well-known rule in C++. The ODR has three parts:

Within a file, each function, variable, type, or template can only have one definition. Definitions occurring in different scopes (e.g. local variables defined inside different functions, or functions defined inside different namespaces) do not violate this rule.
Within a program, each function or variable can only have one definition. This rule exists because programs can have more than one file (we’ll cover this in the next lesson). Functions and variables not visible to the linker are excluded from this rule (discussed further in lesson 7.6 -- Internal linkage).
Types, templates, inline functions, and inline variables are allowed to have duplicate definitions in different files, so long as each definition is identical. We haven’t covered what most of these things are yet, so don’t worry about this for now -- we’ll bring it back up when it’s relevant.
Violating part 1 of the ODR will cause the compiler to issue a redefinition error. Violating ODR part 2 will cause the linker to issue a redefinition error. Violating ODR part 3 will cause undefined behavior.

Here’s an example of a violation of part 1:

Do not #include .cpp files 

Although the preprocessor will happily do so, you should generally not #include .cpp files. These should be added to your project and compiled.

There are number of reasons for this:

Doing so can cause naming collisions between source files.
In a large project it can be hard to avoid one definition rules (ODR) issues.
Any change to such a .cpp file will cause both the .cpp file and any other .cpp file that includes it to recompile, which can take a long time. Headers tend to change less often than source files.
It is non-conventional to do so.
