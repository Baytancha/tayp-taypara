The Git output statements "Merge made by the 'ort' strategy." and "Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy." 
indicate the merge strategy used by Git during a merge operation. These statements are part of the merge 
commit message, providing information about how the merge was performed.

Merge made by the 'ort' strategy
The 'ort' strategy, which stands for "Ostensibly Recursive Three-way," is a newer merge strategy 
introduced to address performance issues and enhance conflict resolution capabilities. It is 
designed to be more efficient, particularly for large repositories or situations where performance 
is a concern. The 'ort' strategy can automatically resolve some conflicts when possible, making 
the conflict resolution process smoother and less manual. It's intended to replace the traditional 
'recursive' strategy over time, offering a more flexible architecture for handling merges and making 
it easier to implement custom merge strategies or integrate third-party merge tools 24.
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy
The 'recursive' strategy is the traditional default merge strategy in Git. It provides basic 
conflict resolution capabilities, marking conflicted areas for manual resolution by the user. 
Despite being well-established and widely supported, it can be less efficient in some cases, 
especially when dealing with large repositories or complex merge histories. The 'recursive' 
strategy is still widely used but is expected to be gradually replaced by the 'ort' strategy 
as Git evolves 24.
In summary, the choice between the 'ort' and 'recursive' strategies depends on the specific 
needs of the merge operation, with 'ort' being more efficient and capable of automatically 
resolving certain conflicts, while 'recursive' remains a well-understood and widely supported 
strategy for basic conflict resolution.
