class Parent {
public:
  void sleep() {}
};

class Child: public Parent {
public:
  void gotoSchool(){}
};

int main( ) 
{ 
  Parent parent;
  Child child;

  // upcast - implicit type cast allowed
  Parent *pParent = &child; 

  // downcast - explicit type case required 
  Child *pChild =  (Child *) &parent;

  pParent -> sleep();
  pChild -> gotoSchool();
    
  return 0; 
}





Downcasting
The opposite process, converting a base-class pointer (reference) to a derived-class pointer (reference) is called downcasting. 
  Downcasting is not allowed without an explicit type cast. The reason for this restriction is that the is-a relationship is not, 
  in most of the cases, symmetric. A derived class could add new data members, and the class member functions that used these data members wouldn't apply to the base class.

As in the example, we derived Child class from a Parent class, adding a member function, gotoSchool(). It wouldn't make sense to apply 
  the gotoSchool() method to a Parent object. However, if implicit downcasting were allowed, we could accidentally assign the address 
  of a Parent object to a pointer-to-Child

Child *pChild =  &parent; // actually this won't compile
        // error: cannot convert from 'Parent *' to 'Child *'
and use the pointer to invoke the gotoSchool() method as in the following line.

pChild -> gotoSchool();
Because a Parent isn't a Child (a Parent need not have a gotoSchool() method), the downcasting in 
  the above line can lead to an unsafe operation.

C++ provides a special explicit cast called dynamic_cast that performs this conversion. 
  Downcasting is the opposite of the basic object-oriented rule, which states objects of a derived class, can always be assigned to variables of a base class.
One more thing about the upcasting:
Because implicit upcasting makes it possible for a base-class pointer (reference) to refer to a base-class 
  object or a derived-class object, there is the need for dynamic binding. That's why we have virtual member functions.

Pointer (Reference) type: known at compile time.
Object type: not known until run time.


int main( ) 
{ 
  Parent *pParent = new Parent;
  Parent *pChild = new Child;
    
  Child *p1 = (Child *) pParent;  // #1
  Parent *p2 = (Child *) pChild;  // #2
  return 0; 
}

Type cast #1 is not safe because it assigns the address of a base-class object (Parent) to a derived class (Child) pointer. 
So, the code would expect the base-class object to have derived class properties such as gotoSchool() method, and that is false. 
Also, Child object, for example, has a member classes that a Parent object is lacking.

Type case #2, however, is safe because it assigns the address of a derived-class object to a base-class pointer. 
In other words, public derivation promises that a Child object is also a Parent object.




Child *p = dynamic_cast<Child *>(pParent)
This code is asking whether the pointer pParent can be type cast safely to the type Child *.

It returns the address of the object, if it can.
It returns 0, otherwise.



How do we use the dynamic_cast?

void f(Parent* p) {
  Child *ptr = dynamic_cast<Child*>(p);
   if(ptr) { 
    // we can safely use ptr
  } 
}
In the code, if (ptr) is of the type Child or else derived directly or indirectly from the type Child, the dynamic_cast converts 
the pointer p to a pointer of type Child. Otherwise, the expression evaluates to 0, the null pointer.

In other words, we want to check if we can use the passed in pointer p before we do some operation on a child class 
object even though it's a pointer to base class.

"The need for dynamic_cast generally arises because we want perform derived class operation on a derived class object, 
but we have only a pointer-or reference-to-base." -Scott Meyers
