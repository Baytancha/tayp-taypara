In C++, when a class member function is declared as static, it means that the function is associated with the class, not an instance of the class. 
The static member function can be called even if no objects of the class exist. It is independent of any particular object of the class 1.

Here are some key characteristics of static member functions in C++:

A static member function can only access static data members, other static member functions, or any other functions from outside the class.
Static member functions have a class scope and they do not have access to the this pointer of the class. This is because the 'this' pointer 
is associated with an object, and static member functions can be called without an object 1.
Static member functions cannot be declared as const, volatile, or virtual because they don't belong to any instance of the class 3.
They can be called using the class name followed by the scope resolution operator 1.
Here's a simple example of a static member function:

class Box {
    private:
        static int length;
        static int breadth;
        static int height;

    public:
        static void print() {
            std::cout << "The value of the length is: " << length << std::endl;
            std::cout << "The value of the breadth is: " << breadth << std::endl;
            std::cout << "The value of the height is: " << height << std::endl;
        }
};

int Box::length = 10;
int Box::breadth = 20;
int Box::height = 30;

int main() {
    Box::print(); // Call static member function
    return 0;
}
In this example, we have a Box class with three static data members: length, breadth, and height. We also have a static
member function named print() that prints the values of these members. Note that we can call the print() function using 
the class name (Box), followed by the scope resolution operator (::), without creating an instance of the class 1.

Static members are often used to keep track of shared data that needs to be the same for all objects of a class. 
For example, you might use a static data member as a counter to keep track of how many objects of a certain class 
have been created. This counter can be incremented each time an object is created, giving you a running total of the number of objects 1.
